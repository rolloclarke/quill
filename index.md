Quill is a **very simple** plain text format for playwriting. Playwrights and theatre people should use it because:

* It's free, in every sense.
* Plain text can be edited on any computer easily
* The plain text itself is nice and readable
* Sending Word or Pages documents around is a ridiculous way to live
* You can use the [converter](converter) to print an even nicer looking script

	So this is what Quill looks like.
	
	BECKETT:
	What's the point? I had a typewriter, but I still wrote plays by hand.
	
	SHAKESPEARE:
	I don't like it either. Give me a real quill any day.

### Getting started

There is no app to buy, you just use any text editor. Nearly every computer comes with a text editor pre-installed, but there are plenty of others available. [TextMate]() is popular (for Mac), as is [Sublime Text]() (Mac, Windows, Linux), or you can use Google Docs, Pages, or Word, just make sure you save the file as plain text. Plain text means anyone else can open the file without any formatting issues.

Writing with quill just means sticking to the [rules](syntax). The rules have been designed to be as simple as possible.

To print a nicely formatted script, you can use the [Converter](converter). You can drop your file in, or just copy and paste. On a Mac you can print directly to PDF.

###Origins

A lot of the conventions used in Quill have been stolen from [Fountain][f] which is an excellent plain text format for screenwriting. Writing plays however is different to writing screenplays[^a].

I well understand that some writers will find adhering to any formatting standard too restrictive. Unlike the television and movie industry, theatre does not have a standard script format, and nor should it. Theatre is inherently more anarchic. Since Quill is free and open source, I have no interest in forcing anyone to use it. I provide it simply as a tool which feels mean-spirited to keep to myself.

[^a]: Theatre often contains longer monologue and it is useful to write this speech in paragraphs. While you can do this with Fountain, it involves inserting spaces on blank lines, and then it becomes difficult to distinguish dialogue from stage direction. Most of the differences between Quill and Fountain stem originally from this.
