# Act One

.Scene 1

[Empty stage. The actors enter. They do not know what they are doing because they ran out of rehearsal time.]

ROLLO:
So this is what Quill looks like.

BECKETT:
What's the point? I had a typewriter, but I still wrote plays by hand.

SHAKESPEARE:
I don't like it either. Give me a real quill any day.

[ROLLO exits, exasperated]
